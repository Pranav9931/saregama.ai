Saregama.ai — Problem, Solution & Tech Stack (with Crossmint Embedded Wallets)




---


🚨 Problem Statement


1. Artists lack control over their distribution rights.


Labels handle distribution, so artists cannot directly upload songs to streaming platforms.
When label contracts end or when artists switch labels, their songs must be taken down, leaving:


Gaps in availability


Loss of income


Loss of visibility




Indie artists suffer the worst:


They often have no backing


They have no distributors


Their catalogs disappear frequently


They have no global reach






---


2. Traditional streaming revenue is extremely low.


Artists earn fractions of a cent per stream.
They are unable to:


Monetize exclusive content


Set premium access


Create rental models


Track streaming transparency






---


3. No platform allows artists to independently publish and retract songs.


Centralized platforms:


Don’t allow direct artist uploads


Cannot delete content on-demand (due to internal archiving)


Cannot store secure chunks


Cannot comply with artist takedown-on-demand requirements




Artists have no safe "self-publishing" environment.




---


4. Geographical restrictions reduce discovery & revenue.


Regional licensing means many songs cannot be streamed globally.




---


5. No transparent on-chain streaming analytics.


Labels want reliable data on streams, geographies, and performance — but platforms don’t expose full analytics.

✅ Solution — Saregama.ai


Saregama.ai is the first artist-first decentralized streaming platform where creators can independently upload, publish, monetize, rent, update, and retract their music securely and globally.




---


🔹 1. Direct artist self-publishing (no labels, no distributors).


Artists upload their music directly through Saregama.ai using a secure pipeline:


File is chunked into HLS segments


Sent to ARKIV for decentralized storage


Artist retains full control (including removal rights)


Playback is delivered globally without region restrictions




Artists become their own label.




---


🔹 2. ARKIV ephemeral storage solves the “legal takedown problem.”


ARKIV lets artists:


Publish securely


Set expiration dates


Remove content instantly when needed


Transition smoothly when signing new contracts




No decentralized network today offers both decentralization + removability — ARKIV does.




---


🔹 3. Rental Streaming Model


Artists can monetize via:


Pay-per-view style renting


Time-limited premium access


Exclusive unreleased tracks


Higher yield compared to traditional streaming




Perfect for special releases, demos, VIP access.




---


🔹 4. Crossmint Embedded Wallets — frictionless onboarding for artists & listeners


You use Crossmint Embedded Wallets to eliminate crypto friction.


What this enables:


Users don’t need to understand wallets or seed phrases


Signup with email, Google, Apple


Wallet is automatically generated in background


Payments & rental validations done via safe wallet signatures




Makes the platform feel like a normal streaming app — but powered by blockchain.


This allows:


Artists to earn immediately


Fans to rent music instantly


Global access without wallet setup barriers






---


🔹 5. On-chain streaming analytics


Every stream generates metadata such as:


Total plays


Region of listener


Engagement timeline


Rental events


Revenue per track




Artists get full transparency, and labels can evaluate artists using trustless data.
